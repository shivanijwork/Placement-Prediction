# 🎯 Placement Prediction System (Mini Project)

A machine learning-based project that predicts whether a student will be placed based on their academic scores, background, and experience. This project was built as part of my academic learning to explore supervised learning techniques and model evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Predicts **placement status** using historical student data.
- Compares the performance of **6 machine learning models**.
- Includes **data preprocessing**, **visualizations**, and **accuracy comparison**.
- Displays **placement probability** using logistic regression.

## 🧠 Models Used & Accuracy

| Model                    | Accuracy |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression      | 88.3%    |
| Decision Tree            | 83.7%    |
| Random Forest            | 81.3%    |
| Gradient Boosting        | 81.3%    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors      | 79.0%    |
| Support Vector Machine   | 76.7%    |

➡️ Logistic Regression performed best and is used for final prediction.
